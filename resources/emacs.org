This introductory list of resources can help you get started with
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html][emacs]].

Emacs is self documenting. To really learn how to use it, try
completing the builtin tutorial.

Here is a list of all the dotfiles I have used as references when
building my own configuration.

This is a nice overview of example configurations from github.

Very nice collection of dotfiles for both emacs and other system
dotfiles. Gives a nice talk on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dljNabciEGg][literate devops]].

John does a lot of similar work with reproducible research. I have
used his setup for \LaTeX setup as well as his org-ref for citations.

- Guy that makes ivy/swipper avy and other very useful tools.

- Came across his dotfiles while configuring swiper
- Interesting looking themes

His youtube video on combining use-package with org configuration was
the motivation for converting my literate setup with the org-mode
files from the starter kit to this more streamlined approach.

I copied a lot of his examples when initially setting up this file
when trying to get a better handle on the use-package functionality.
